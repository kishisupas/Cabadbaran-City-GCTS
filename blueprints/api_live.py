"""
Live vehicle positions for the maps.

    GET /api/live/vehicles?type=&barangay=

Scope is decided here, from the session, never from the query string:

    public / no login   on-duty vehicles, position and vehicle code only
    barangay admin      their own barangay's vehicles, with collector names
    city admin          everything
    collector           their own marker

The public map needs to show residents where the truck is, so positions are
public by design -- that is the point of the system. What is *not* public is
who is driving: an anonymous viewer gets the vehicle code and nothing that
identifies a person.

Phase 7 pushes these over a socket; this endpoint stays as the 30-second
polling fallback for when the socket is down.
