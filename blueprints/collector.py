"""
Field collector portals -- tricycle (household route) and truck (MRF route).

Both roles share one blueprint because their screens are structurally
identical: a work list, a per-stop record form, an unavailability request, a
history feed, and a profile. Only the unit of work differs -- a household for
the tricycle, a barangay MRF for the truck.

Designed mobile-first (these are used one-handed, outdoors, on a phone) but the
templates lay out into multiple columns from 900px up, so the same pages work
at a desk.

Both sides now run on the JSON store. The truck operator records no
quantities: an MRF card's load is computed from that barangay's collection
entries, so the number the truck carries is the number the tricycles brought in
(spec section 7).
