"""
Public viewer -- the citizen-facing pages. No authentication.

Four tabs, mobile-first, because residents open this on a phone at the kerb:

    /public/            live map of the collectors working right now
    /public/schedule    month calendar + the coming week
    /public/today       what is accepted today
    /public/report      "was your waste collected?" -- anonymous

Nothing here trusts the client. The report form re-validates every field, the
rate limit is enforced server-side, and a resident's report can never overwrite
a collector's record (see public_report_service).
