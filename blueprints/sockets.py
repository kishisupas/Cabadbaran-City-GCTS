"""
Socket.IO event handlers.

Two rules run through all of this, both from spec section 8:

  * **Room joins are validated against the session role.** The client never
    names the rooms it wants; the server works them out from the account and
    joins them on connect. A browser cannot subscribe to a barangay it has no
    business seeing by editing one line of JavaScript.

  * **A location update is accepted only from the collector it belongs to.**
    The user id comes from the session, and any id in the payload is ignored --
    otherwise one collector could drive another's marker around the map.

Handlers mirror the REST endpoints rather than replacing them. If the socket
is down the client polls every 30 seconds and nothing is lost; if it is up,
the same data arrives sooner.
