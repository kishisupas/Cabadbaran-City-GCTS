"""
Seed the JSON store with the reference data the system cannot start without.

    python seed.py

Idempotent by design: every record is matched on a natural key (barangay id,
vehicle code, username, schedule day) and skipped if already present. Re-run it
as often as you like -- it will never duplicate a row, and it will never
overwrite an edit an admin has since made through the UI.

What it creates:
  * 31 barangays, numbered 1-31, with puroks and a derived zone colour group
  * 31 tricycle units (TRI-01..TRI-31) and 8 truck units (TRK-01..TRK-08)
  * the default weekly waste schedule
  * one City Hall Admin account -- the only account that can create the rest
  * placeholder geo files, pre-filled with all 31 barangay ids so that
    supplying the real data is a fill-in-the-blanks job

Seeded accounts share one known password so that a fresh local store and a
fresh deploy produce identical logins -- see seed_password(). Override it per
deployment with SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD / SEED_DEMO_PASSWORD. Stored only as a
werkzeug hash, and nobody is forced to change it: the Profile page offers a
password change, it is never demanded.
