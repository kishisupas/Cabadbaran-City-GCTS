Set a known password on the demo/admin accounts.

Only for the seeded walkthrough accounts. Real accounts get their passwords
from the City Hall Admin's User Management page; this exists so the capstone
demo has logins you can hand to a panel without digging through seed output.
Stored hashed, exactly like every other password in the system.
