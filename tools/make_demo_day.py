"""
Fill the store with the weeks a working system would have behind it, so the
system is presented mid-life rather than on its first morning.

    python tools/make_demo_day.py              # the last three weeks, to today
    python tools/make_demo_day.py --days 14    # a shorter history
    python tools/make_demo_day.py --reset      # clear generated activity first

Why this exists: a freshly seeded system is correct but empty -- every card
reads 0, every table shows its empty state, and the chart has nothing to draw.
That is the right behaviour for a new install and the wrong thing to put in
front of a capstone panel.

What it tells, day by day, in the order it would have happened:

  * a few days before go-live, City Hall sets up the accounts and the
    barangays register their households -- so every "Date Created" is a real
    spread of dates, not one minute at boot;
  * from go-live, every scheduled collection day: the tricycles work their
    rounds under that day's waste type, the trucks collect the MRFs, some
    stops are missed, residents report, disputes are raised and settled, and
    a collector is off sick now and then;
  * missed MRF loads become carry-overs that City Hall arranges and a truck
    collects on a later day;
  * each finished day is closed and frozen into History, as the app does at
    midnight, and a few households register mid-way;
  * today is left in progress.

Every date is counted back from today, so it works the same on each Render
boot, and the random seed is fixed, so the same demo comes out each time.

It writes through the same storage module the app uses, so nothing here is a
special case the real code has to know about, and it is idempotent: running it
twice on the same day adds nothing. Run with --reset and the system is back
to a clean seeded state.
