"""
Application configuration.

Every tunable that a deployment might need to change lives here, so no route,
template, or JS file has to be edited to point the system at a different city,
turn a layer on, or move the data directory.

Nothing in this file is a credential. SECRET_KEY comes from the environment;
if it is absent a random key is generated once and persisted to
`instance/.secret_key` so sessions survive a restart without anybody having to
paste a secret into source control.

Deployment overrides, all optional and all read from the environment:

    SECRET_KEY      required in production -- see the warning in _secret_key()
    DATA_ROOT       where the JSON store and uploads live. On a host with an
                    ephemeral filesystem (Render, Heroku, most containers)
                    this MUST point at a mounted persistent disk, or every
                    record is lost on the next deploy or restart.
    FLASK_ENV       set to "production" to harden the session cookie
