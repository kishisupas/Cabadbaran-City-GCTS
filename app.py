"""
Cabadbaran City -- Garbage Collection Tracking System
Flask application factory and entry point.

Run with:  python app.py      (http://127.0.0.1:5000)

Started through Flask-SocketIO rather than `app.run`, so the live map, the
dashboard counters, and the notification bell update over a websocket. The
REST endpoints stay in place as the polling fallback, so the app is fully
usable if the socket cannot connect.

    That is not just cosmetic: the barangay filter zooms by fitting a
    polygon's bounds, so with no polygons the map cannot zoom to a barangay at
    all, on the public page and the admin pages alike. render.yaml runs
    make_demo_geo.py right after seed.py for this reason; a local run had no
