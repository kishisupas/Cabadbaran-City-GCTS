# Geospatial Data Requirements

Everything the maps draw comes from three files in `data/geo/`. The system
ships with valid placeholders so it runs today; this document tells you exactly
what to collect and how to drop the real data in.

**You will not need to edit a single route, template, or JavaScript file.**
Replace the files, refresh the browser, and the maps pick the data up — the
loader watches file modification times, so not even a server restart is needed.

---

## The short answer: what data do you actually need?

Exactly two numbers per barangay, and one of them is optional at first.

| # | What to collect | Per barangay | Gets you |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **MRF coordinate** — lat, lng of the facility gate | 1 point | The MRF marker, the "truck approaching" alert, hotspot anchoring |
| 2 | **Boundary outline** — lat, lng of each corner | 3+ points (10–30 is typical) | The coloured barangay zone on every map |

Nothing else. Vehicle positions come from the collectors' phones at runtime,
the zone colours are derived from the barangay numbers, and the map background
is free OpenStreetMap or Esri satellite tiles. There is no paid map service and
no API key anywhere in this system.

**Start with #1.** Thirty-one coordinates is an afternoon's work and it lights
up the MRF markers and the arrival alerts. Boundaries can come later — and if
your City Planning Office has a shapefile, they come for free (section 1).

### The easy route: a spreadsheet

You do not have to hand-write GeoJSON. Generate blank CSVs, type the
coordinates in Excel or Google Sheets, and let the importer build the files:

```bash
python tools/geo_from_csv.py --template   # writes data/geo/input/*.csv
#   ... fill in the lat and lng columns ...
python tools/geo_from_csv.py --check      # validate, change nothing
python tools/geo_from_csv.py              # import into data/geo/
```

`data/geo/input/mrf_points.csv` arrives pre-filled with all 31 barangay ids and
names — you only add `lat` and `lng`:

```csv
barangay_id,barangay_name,mrf_name,lat,lng,notes
brgy-01,Antonio Luna,Antonio Luna MRF,9.124700,125.533900,beside the covered court
brgy-02,Bay-ang,Bay-ang MRF,,,not visited yet
```

`data/geo/input/barangay_zones.csv` takes one row per corner of the outline,
walked around the boundary in order:

```csv
barangay_id,barangay_name,point_order,lat,lng
brgy-01,Antonio Luna,1,9.129800,125.531200
brgy-01,Antonio Luna,2,9.131020,125.540150
brgy-01,Antonio Luna,3,9.126100,125.543880
brgy-01,Antonio Luna,4,9.119550,125.541020
```

Three things the importer does for you:

- **Both CSVs take `lat, lng`** — the order your phone and Google Maps give it.
  GeoJSON wants the opposite, and the importer flips it. That single reversal
  is the most common way this data goes wrong; you now cannot get it wrong.
- **Closes each polygon ring** by repeating the first point, as GeoJSON requires.
- **Rejects a coordinate outside Cabadbaran** with a message naming the row,
  instead of letting a swapped pair put a barangay in the Indian Ocean.

Partial data is fine and expected. Fill in five MRFs and those five draw; the
other 26 are reported as unlocated and simply do not appear. `--check` tells
you how many are still missing at any point.

### How to capture one coordinate

Stand at the spot and read it off any phone GPS app, or right-click the place
in Google Maps and copy the `9.1247, 125.5339` pair it shows. Five to six
decimal places is about a metre — more precision than this system needs.

For the MRF points, **accuracy matters**: they drive the "Truck TRK-02
approaching Brgy 14 MRF" alert, which fires at 500 m
(`Config.TRUCK_APPROACH_METRES`). A point 600 m off makes that alert fire at
the wrong moment.

### Until then, the placeholders

The system ships with **illustrative placeholder geography** for all 31
barangays and all 31 MRFs, so every map, alert, and page works today. It is
generated, not surveyed — see the next section — and the app never presents it
as real: `/api/geo/status` reports `placeholder: true` and every map carries
the caption *"Boundaries and MRF pins are illustrative approximations, not
surveyed data."* Feeding in real data removes that caption automatically.

---

## At a glance

| File | What it holds | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| `barangay_zones.geojson` | 31 barangay boundary polygons | The coloured zones on every map |
| `mrf_locations.json` | One MRF point per barangay | MRF markers, truck-approach alerts, hotspot anchoring |
| `hotspots.geojson` | Known problem areas (optional) | The hotspot overlay, when `HOTSPOT_SOURCE = "file"` |

Check what is currently loaded at any time:

```
GET /api/geo/status
```

It reports how many zones have real geometry, how many MRFs have coordinates,
and whether each file is still a placeholder.

---

## What is in `data/geo/` right now

`barangay_zones.geojson` and `mrf_locations.json` currently hold **illustrative
demo data**, generated by `tools/make_demo_geo.py`. All 31 barangays have a
polygon and all 31 MRFs have coordinates, so the maps draw a populated city —
but **none of it was surveyed**:

- Each barangay is placed by rough compass direction from the city centre, at
  roughly the right distance. It is not on its real footprint.
- Boundaries are generated shapes sized to not overlap their neighbours, not
  real boundary lines.
- MRF pins sit near their barangay centre, not at the real facility.

Because both files keep `"_placeholder": true`, the system never presents this
as real: `/api/geo/status` reports `placeholder: true`, and every map shows the
caption *"Boundaries and MRF pins are illustrative approximations, not surveyed
data."* Replacing them with real data is the file swap described in section 4 —
no code changes.

To regenerate or adjust the approximation, edit `RURAL_CENTRES` in
`tools/make_demo_geo.py` and re-run it:

```bash
python tools/make_demo_geo.py            # rewrite the two files
python tools/make_demo_geo.py --stdout   # preview, change nothing
```

Shapes are seeded on the barangay id, so regenerating produces the same map
rather than reshuffling it.

---

## 1. `barangay_zones.geojson` — barangay boundaries

A standard GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` with **31 features**, one per barangay.

### Required properties on every feature

| Property | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `barangay_id` | string | Must match `data/barangays.json` exactly: `brgy-01` … `brgy-31` |
| `name` | string | Barangay name, for the map label |
| `zone_group` | string | `zone-a`, `zone-b`, `zone-c`, or `zone-d` — the four colour groups |

### Geometry

`Polygon` or `MultiPolygon`. Coordinates are **`[longitude, latitude]`** in that
order — this trips people up constantly, because the rest of the system says
"lat, lng". GeoJSON is always lng-first. Use decimal degrees, WGS84 (EPSG:4326),
5–6 decimal places (~1 m precision). Close each ring by repeating the first
point as the last.

### Zone groups

Group membership follows the barangay **number**, not its position on the map:

| Group | Barangay numbers | Colour on the map |
|---|---|---|
| `zone-a` | 1–6 | Blue |
| `zone-b` | 7–14 | Green |
| `zone-c` | 15–22 | Amber |
| `zone-d` | 23–31 | Violet |

The numbering lives in `seed.py` (`BARANGAY_NAMES`, alphabetical, Poblacion 1–12
in numeric order). **If Cabadbaran has an official barangay numbering, change
that list to match it** and re-run `python seed.py` on a fresh `data/` — the
zone colours follow automatically.

### Fully worked example

Barangay 1, Antonio Luna, in zone group A. This is a real, valid feature — the
coordinates are illustrative, but the structure is exactly what you need:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "barangay_id": "brgy-01",
        "name": "Antonio Luna",
        "zone_group": "zone-a"
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            [125.53120, 9.12980],
            [125.54015, 9.13102],
            [125.54388, 9.12610],
            [125.54102, 9.11955],
            [125.53344, 9.11890],
            [125.52988, 9.12401],
            [125.53120, 9.12980]
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note the `_placeholder: true` flag at the top of the shipped file. **Delete that
line** when you paste real data in, or the system will keep treating the file as
a stub and reporting "no boundaries loaded".

### Where to get the polygons

- The City Planning and Development Office or the City Assessor usually holds
  barangay boundary shapefiles.
- PhilGIS (`philgis.org`) publishes free administrative boundary shapefiles down
  to barangay level for Agusan del Norte.
- OpenStreetMap has partial coverage; export with the Overpass API.
- A `.shp` file converts to GeoJSON with QGIS: *Layer → Save As → GeoJSON*, CRS
  set to EPSG:4326. Then add the three required properties to each feature.

---

## 2. `mrf_locations.json` — MRF coordinates

A JSON array with **one object per barangay** (31 total). The shipped file is
already pre-filled with all 31 `barangay_id`s and names — you only need to fill
in the numbers.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `barangay_id` | string | `brgy-01` … `brgy-31` |
| `name` | string | e.g. `"Antonio Luna MRF"` |
| `lat` | number | Decimal degrees, e.g. `9.12345` |
| `lng` | number | Decimal degrees, e.g. `125.53421` |

```json
[
  { "barangay_id": "brgy-01", "name": "Antonio Luna MRF", "lat": 9.12470, "lng": 125.53388 },
  { "barangay_id": "brgy-02", "name": "Bay-ang MRF",      "lat": 9.15012, "lng": 125.56104 }
]
```

Remove the leading `{"_placeholder": true, ...}` object when you supply real data.

**Partial data is fine.** Fill in five MRFs and those five get markers; the other
26 are reported as `unlocated` and simply do not draw. Nothing breaks, and
`/api/geo/status` tells you how many are still missing.

### How to capture a coordinate

Stand at the MRF gate and read the coordinates off any phone GPS app, or right-
click the spot in Google Maps and copy the `9.1247, 125.5339` pair it shows.
Order is always **lat, lng** in this file — the opposite of the GeoJSON above.

**Accuracy matters here.** These points drive the "Truck TRK-02 approaching
Brgy 14 MRF" alert, which fires at 500 m (`Config.TRUCK_APPROACH_METRES`). A
coordinate that is 600 m off will make the alert fire at the wrong moment or not
at all.

---

## 3. `hotspots.geojson` — problem areas (optional)

**You can skip this file entirely.** By default `HOTSPOT_SOURCE = "derived"`,
which computes hotspots from data the system already collects: Not Collected
entries plus resident reports, grouped by barangay and purok over a rolling
30-day window. That works from day one with no external data.

Supply this file only when you have surveyed hotspot data that the system cannot
infer — illegal dumping sites, chronic problem corners, hazardous areas. Then set
`HOTSPOT_SOURCE = "file"` in `config.py`.

Points or polygons, with these properties:

| Property | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hotspot_id` | string | Any stable unique id |
| `barangay_id` | string | `brgy-01` … `brgy-31` |
| `purok` | string | e.g. `"Purok 3"` |
| `severity` | string | `low`, `medium`, or `high` |
| `type` | string | e.g. `"illegal_dumping"`, `"uncollected"` |
| `last_reported` | string | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `notes` | string | Free text shown in the popup |

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "hotspot_id": "hs-001",
        "barangay_id": "brgy-01",
        "purok": "Purok 3",
        "severity": "high",
        "type": "illegal_dumping",
        "last_reported": "2026-08-14",
        "notes": "Roadside dumping beside the creek crossing."
      },
      "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [125.53390, 9.12455] }
    }
  ]
}
```

### One honest limitation

Derived hotspots are grouped by **purok** but positioned at the **barangay's**
MRF (or, failing that, its polygon centroid), because the system has no purok
geometry. Three hotspots in three different puroks of one barangay therefore
stack on the same point.

To fix that, supply purok centroids — either as a `hotspots.geojson` with real
per-purok points, or by adding a `purok_points` array to a barangay's zone
feature. Until then, `/api/geo/hotspots` returns `meta.anchored_to: "barangay"`
on every derived feature so the UI can be upfront about it.

---

## 4. Swapping the real data in

> If you filled in the CSVs from the top of this document, you are already
> done — `python tools/geo_from_csv.py` performed all of the steps below,
> keeping the files it replaced as `*.backup`. The manual route follows for
> when you have GeoJSON straight out of QGIS.

1. **Back up first.**
   ```
   cp -r data/geo data/geo.backup
   ```

2. **Replace the files.** Copy your real `barangay_zones.geojson`,
   `mrf_locations.json`, and (optionally) `hotspots.geojson` into `data/geo/`,
   overwriting the placeholders.

3. **Delete the placeholder flags.** Remove `"_placeholder": true` from the top
   of each file, and the leading `{"_placeholder": ...}` object from
   `mrf_locations.json`. The system keeps reporting a file as a stub while that
   flag is present.

4. **Check it loaded.** Open `/api/geo/status` in a browser:
   ```json
   { "zones": { "loaded": 31, "total": 31, "placeholder": false },
     "mrfs":  { "loaded": 31, "total": 31, "placeholder": false } }
   ```
   `loaded` should equal `total`. If `loaded` is 0, the most likely causes are a
   `barangay_id` that does not match `brgy-01`…`brgy-31`, or coordinates written
   lat-first when GeoJSON wants lng-first (your barangays will appear somewhere
   in Somalia — a `[9.1, 125.5]` pair read as lng-first lands off the coast of
   Africa).

5. **Refresh the map.** No restart needed — the loader notices the changed file.

6. **Turn on hotspots when you want them:** set `HOTSPOT_LAYER_ENABLED = True`
   in `config.py`.

---

## 5. Validating before you commit

```bash
# Valid JSON?
python -c "import json; json.load(open('data/geo/barangay_zones.geojson'))"

# All 31 ids present and correct?
python -c "
import json
f = json.load(open('data/geo/barangay_zones.geojson'))
ids = {x['properties']['barangay_id'] for x in f['features']}
want = {f'brgy-{n:02d}' for n in range(1, 32)}
print('missing:', sorted(want - ids) or 'none')
print('unexpected:', sorted(ids - want) or 'none')
"

# Coordinates inside Cabadbaran's rough bounding box?
python -c "
import json
f = json.load(open('data/geo/mrf_locations.json'))
for r in f:
    if not isinstance(r, dict) or r.get('lat') is None: continue
    if not (9.0 < r['lat'] < 9.3 and 125.4 < r['lng'] < 125.7):
        print('suspicious:', r['barangay_id'], r['lat'], r['lng'])
print('bounds check done')
"
```

---

## 6. Data the system does *not* need from you

To be clear about scope — none of these require external data files:

- **Live vehicle positions** come from the collectors' phone GPS at runtime.
- **Zone colours** are derived from barangay numbers in `config.py`.
- **Purok lists** live in `data/barangays.json` and are editable through the
  admin UI (currently seeded as Purok 1–7 for every barangay — correct these
  whenever you have the real lists).
- **The map background** is one of two keyless basemaps, chosen from the
  layer control in the map's top-right corner and configured in
  `Config.MAP_BASEMAPS`:

  | Basemap | Source | Detail over Cabadbaran |
  |---|---|---|
  | Streets *(default)* | OpenStreetMap | Whatever volunteers have mapped — good in the Poblacion, thin in the outer barangays. Named streets, to z19. |
  | Satellite | Esri World Imagery + Esri place labels | The ground as it is, no mapping required. Real imagery to z18; z19 is an upscale of it. |

  Neither needs an API key or a bill. If OSM's street coverage is the gap,
  the durable fix is to add the missing roads to OpenStreetMap itself — the
  app picks them up with no change, and the city keeps the data.

  **Google is not a URL swap.** Google's terms do not allow its tiles to be
  loaded into Leaflet; using Google means their Maps JavaScript API with a
  billing-enabled key, which is a second map library on the page. A keyed
  raster provider (MapTiler, Thunderforest, Stadia) *is* a URL swap — one
  more entry in `MAP_BASEMAPS`.
