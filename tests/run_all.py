"""
Run every phase's checks.

    python tests/run_all.py

Each file is a standalone script rather than a pytest suite, so it runs with
no test dependency at all -- in keeping with the project's stack constraint.
Phases 0 and 2-9 build their own throwaway data directory and clean it up;
phase 1 exercises the live store and reissues the demo passwords as a side
effect, which is why it prints them.
