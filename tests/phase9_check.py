"""
Phase 9 verification: cross-role integration.

Every other phase checks one area in isolation. This one checks the joins --
that an action taken by one role actually reaches the other roles who need it,
by both routes that matter:

    LIVE   the socket fan-out, for whoever happens to have the page open
    STORED what the other role's own read path returns afterwards, which is
           what they see on their next page load whether or not they were
           online when it happened

The second is the one that must never fail. A missed socket frame costs
someone a few seconds; a figure that never lands in the store is wrong until
somebody notices by hand.
