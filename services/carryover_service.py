"""
Carry-overs -- MRF loads that were not picked up and must be collected later.

The lifecycle from spec section 7, in three stages:

    truck marks Not Collected
      -> Missed Collection   (no truck, no date -- nobody has acted yet)
      -> admin Reassign AND Reschedule
      -> Pending             (a named truck on a named date; it will be got)
      -> that truck collects the MRF
      -> Collected           (closed by the pickup itself, not by a tick-box)

The three stages are the admin's worklist in order: **Missed Collection** is
work waiting on a decision, **Pending** is work already arranged, **Collected**
is the archive. Splitting the first two matters because they need different
things from the admin -- a missed load needs assigning, a pending one only
needs watching -- and a single "open" list hid the difference.

A load is only Pending once it has *both* a truck and a date: a truck with no
date nobody is coming on, and a date with no truck nobody is coming for. Until
both are set the row stays in Missed Collection, where it is still being
chased. Because the stage is derived from those two fields (see `stage_of`),
it can never drift from them, and rows written before this split read
correctly without a migration.

A carry-over is one missed day's batch at one MRF, with that day's waste type
and load. The trucks' lists are daily and never mix days, so an earlier day's
load is not quietly swept into a later day's pickup: it waits here until the
admin arranges it, then appears on that truck's page as its own carry-over
stop on the arranged date. Closing one is driven by that stop's pickup rather
than by an admin ticking it off.
