"""
Anonymous resident reports.

A resident says whether their waste was collected. No account, no name -- so
two things need care:

**Rate limiting.** Anything anonymous invites abuse, so a device may file at
most `Config.PUBLIC_REPORT_DAILY_LIMIT` reports per day. The limit is keyed on
a *salted hash* of the IP, never the IP itself: a raw address stored next to a
household's name and purok is identifying information the system has no need
to keep, and the hash enforces the limit just as well.

**Conflict handling.** A resident's "Not Collected" must never silently
overwrite a collector's "Collected" (spec section 7). When the two disagree,
both records are kept and the collection entry is flagged **Disputed** for the
barangay admin to resolve -- with the collector's photo proof already attached
for them to look at.
