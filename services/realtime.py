"""
The real-time layer -- Socket.IO rooms and events.

Rooms (spec section 4):

    public              everyone, logged in or not
    barangay:<id>       that barangay's admin, and collectors working it
    role:city_admin     every City Hall Admin
    user:<id>           one person

**Room membership is decided by the server from the session, never requested
by the client.** A browser that asks to join `barangay:07` gets whatever its
own account entitles it to and nothing more; otherwise anyone could subscribe
to every barangay's live vehicle positions and notifications by editing one
line of JavaScript.

Everything here degrades to a no-op when Socket.IO is not running -- during
tests, or under a WSGI server without websocket support. `emit_to()` checks
and returns quietly, so no service needs to care whether the socket layer is
up. The REST endpoints remain the 30-second polling fallback either way.
