"""
On Duty / Off Duty, and the last known position of each collector.

Spec 6.4 flags the duty toggle as missing logic. It matters for more than a
badge: going On Duty starts the browser sharing GPS, puts the collector on
every live map, and is what the "27 active now: 23 Tricycles and 4 Trucks"
counters actually count. Off Duty stops the sharing and removes the marker --
a collector who has gone home should not still appear to be working a route.

Duty state and last position live on the user record. There is no separate
collection because there is exactly one current state per collector; history
of movement is not something the system is asked to keep, and storing a
position stream would be a meaningful privacy decision nobody has made.
