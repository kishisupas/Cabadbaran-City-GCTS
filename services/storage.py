"""
JSON file storage.

Every read and write of a collection goes through this module -- no route or
template may call `open()` on a data file. That single choke point is what
makes the three guarantees below possible:

  atomic writes   data is written to a temp file in the same directory and
                  then os.replace()d over the target, so a crash mid-write can
                  never leave a half-written (corrupt) collection behind
  per-file locks  one reentrant lock per collection serialises writers inside
                  the process, and an OS file lock serialises them across
                  processes -- so neither two requests nor two workers nor a
                  `seed.py` run against a live server can clobber each other
  auto-create     a missing collection is created with its default shape on
                  first touch, so a fresh checkout just runs

Read-modify-write must go through `transaction()`, which holds the lock across
the whole cycle. Doing `rows = read(); rows.append(x); write(rows)` outside a
transaction is a lost-update bug waiting to happen -- the helpers below
(`insert`, `update`, `delete`) all use it.

Swapping this file for SQLite later means reimplementing these functions only;
nothing above it knows the data lives in files.
