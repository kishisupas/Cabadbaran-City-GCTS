"""
Households and establishments -- the things a tricycle collector collects from.

Barangay admins own this list for their own barangay (Phase 5); collectors read
the slice of it that matches their assignment; the City Hall Admin sees all of
it. Every read here takes the scope as an argument rather than reaching for the
session, so the caller cannot accidentally widen it.

A property record carries no status. Status belongs to a *date* and lives in
`collections.json` -- see collection_service. That is what makes "Pending"
mean "no record for today" and history come out for free.

# Two of the tags above say what a household does NOT produce, so on the days

# the property sits Pending all day, drags the collector's completion figure
# down, and can only be cleared by photographing an empty kerb to prove a
# negative the barangay already knew.
#
# Keyed on the schedule's waste_type, not on the day of the week: the schedule
# is editable in the admin UI, so Wednesday is not permanently biodegradable.
#
# CAVEAT worth knowing before trusting this: on Mon/Wed/Fri the schedule's
# details are Kitchen Waste, Yard Waste AND "Diaper / Used Tissue / Sanitary
# Napkins". A composting household composts the first two but still produces
# the third, so treating the whole day as exempt for them is the city's policy
# call, not a fact. Narrow it by removing that waste_type here if the client
# decides those households should still be visited.
