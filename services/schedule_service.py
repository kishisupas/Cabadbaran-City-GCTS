"""
The weekly waste schedule.

One record per weekday in `waste_schedule.json`. The City Hall Admin edits it;
barangay admins, collectors, and the public viewer all read it. It is the only
place the waste types are defined, which matters more than it looks: a
collection entry offers the waste types from *that day's* schedule row, so
editing Tuesday here changes what a collector can record on a Tuesday.

"Kitchen Waste" is the agreed citywide term. The mockup's dashboard chart said
"Food Waste" for the same thing; that is a mockup inconsistency, not a second
category.
