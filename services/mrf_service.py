"""
Barangay MRF pickups and landfill deliveries -- the truck operator's work.

The aggregation chain from spec section 7 runs through here, and the whole
point of it is that nothing is entered twice:

    tricycle entries -> barangay Overall Collected Load
                     -> that barangay's MRF card, shown to the truck
                     -> the truck's running Overall Collected Load
                     -> the delivery totals
                     -> the city MRF page

So the truck operator records no quantities. The load on an MRF card is
computed from that barangay's collection entries, and confirming "Collect"
simply moves it along the chain.

**Every day is its own list.** An MRF card for a date carries only that date's
batch -- what the tricycles brought in *that day*, under *that day's* waste
type -- and it is Pending until the truck records Collected or Not Collected.
Nothing from an earlier day is mixed into it. A Monday of biodegradable waste
shows biodegradable waste, even if Saturday's special waste is still sitting
in the MRF.

What happens to a batch the truck did not take is the Carry-Over page's job,
not the next day's card's. A miss -- recorded by the operator, or marked
automatically when the day closes with nothing recorded -- opens a carry-over
for that one batch. It reappears on a truck's page only once the City Hall
Admin has given it a truck and a date, and then as a separate, labelled
carry-over stop with its own day and waste type: a pickup of `kind`
"carry_over", recorded against that carry-over, beside the day's regular list
rather than folded into it.

Pickups written before `kind` existed read as regular ones.
