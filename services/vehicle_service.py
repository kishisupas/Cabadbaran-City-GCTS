"""
Vehicle registry -- the TRI and TRK units the assign dropdowns draw from.

Spec section 6.3 flags this as missing logic: the assignment forms need
registered units to come from somewhere. A unit is one of three states:

    available   registered, not currently on an active assignment
    assigned    held by an active assignment
    inactive    withdrawn from service (breakdown, sold, retired)

`status` is derived from the assignment records rather than stored as the
truth, so a unit can never get stuck showing "assigned" after its assignment
is deleted. The stored field only distinguishes inactive from in-service.
