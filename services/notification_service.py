"""
Notifications -- the bell, and the barangay dashboard's alerts card.

Every notification is addressed to an **audience**, not to a list of people:

    public              everyone, including the public viewer
    role:city_admin     every City Hall Admin
    barangay:<id>       that barangay's admin
    user:<id>           one person

Addressing by audience rather than by recipient is what lets a notification
survive staff changes: "the Brgy 14 admin" is a role someone holds, and a new
admin should see the alerts for their barangay without anything being rewritten.

Read state is per person (`read_by`), so one admin marking an alert read does
not hide it from their colleague.

Phase 7 adds the automatic triggers (truck approaching, scheduled arrival,
assignment changed, and so on) on top of `create()`.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Where a notification takes you
#
# Tapping an alert should land on the page that answers it: "carry-over
# created" on the worklist where an admin reassigns it, "resident report" on
# the page that shows the report. The destination therefore depends on who is
# looking -- the same carry-over alert is a job for City Hall and an
# explanation for the barangay whose MRF was missed.
#
# Resolved at read time from the notification's type rather than stored on the
# row. An alert raised before this existed still links, and a renamed route is
# one edit here instead of a data migration.
#
# A (type, role) pair with no entry is informational and renders as plain text
# rather than as a link to somewhere unhelpful -- a collector has no schedule
# page, so "schedule updated" stays text for them.
