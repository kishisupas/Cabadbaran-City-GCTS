"""
Automatic notification triggers (spec section 5).

Each function is called at the moment the condition becomes true, stores the
notification, and pushes it to the right rooms. Two of them fire on repeating
conditions and so must not spam:

  * **Truck approaching** is evaluated on every GPS ping. A truck idling near
    an MRF would otherwise raise an alert every few seconds, so it fires once
    per truck per MRF per day, keyed on a dedupe string.
  * **Scheduled arrival** (T-2h) is checked lazily on requests rather than by
    a scheduler, matching the end-of-day job. Same once-per-day keying.

Everything here is best-effort: a notification that fails to send must never
break the action that triggered it. The caller has already saved its data.
