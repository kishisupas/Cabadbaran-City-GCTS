"""
Collection entries -- what a tricycle collector recorded at one property on
one date.

The status model is the spine of the whole system (spec section 7):

    a property is **Pending** for a date simply because no record exists for
    that date. Saving an entry makes it Collected or Not Collected.

Nothing is reset at midnight. Every "today" view queries today's Manila date,
so yesterday keeps its own answer and history is automatic.

Loads are always totalled **sacks and kilos separately**. They are different
units; adding them produces a number that means nothing, and the mockup's
"43 sacks" against rows summing to 35 is exactly that mistake.
